# Lua Flight Timer

![Lua Flight Timer](https://i.imgur.com/Wd6Lls9.jpg)

FlyWithLua flight timer with the X-Plane system time (X-Plane bulit in timer datarefs - always determining the proper "in simulation" time). Useful in VFR flights with a orthophoto scenery (timer automatically slows down when a decrease of FPS occurs e.g. caused by loading of the new tiles) and on low-end systems below 20fps.

It can be used with the lua autopilot script "HUD module test" included in FlyWithLua package.
